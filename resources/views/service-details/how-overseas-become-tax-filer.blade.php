							<h3 class="title">Pakistan-sourced income</h3>
						</div>
						<ul class="check-lists">
							<li>Pakistan-sourced income is meant by any income which is earned in Pakistan that is taxable regardless of its receiving. This means that if Pakistani is receiving remuneration from an employer in Pakistan then his income tax at source will most likely be deducted from his salary even if he ex-pats residing in a foreign country.</li>
							<li>It is essential to mention that just deduction of income tax from your salary does not mean that you have become a tax filer automatically. To be acknowledged as a filer in Pakistan, you are required to be added to the Federal Board of Revenue's Active Taxpayers List.</li>
							<li>Furthermore, suppose an ex-pat has immovable or movable assets in Pakistan, such as a house or a motor vehicle which is purchased exclusively from foreign income. In this case, there is need to prove that the money was remitted outside the country. They need to apprehend that the said transaction was carried out via proper channels and as per instructions mentioned by the State Bank of Pakistan. In 2018, FBR decided to waive off the withholding tax applicable on the withdrawals of remittances, i.e. the funds sent to the home (Pakistan) by a non-resident Pakistanis.</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="desc pb-30">
							FBR and other concerned authorities can inquire into any taxpayer's assets and elaborate the source, if needed as per the Pakistani tax laws.

								After login in to the IRIS Portal, click the icon 'Declaration' appearing on the top of the screen.

								If you have no any Pakistan source of income then select and open the form 114(1) (Return of Income filed voluntarily by a Non-Resident Pakistani person having no Pakistan-source income).

								Your status or rank as a 'resident' or a 'non-resident' is to be selected in the 'Attributes' section accordingly on the basis of how many days you have spent in Pakistan during the relevant fiscal year and enter relevant information in the draft thereon.

							<li>
								Furthermore, when you are earning income which is taxable in Pakistan then you are required to declare the Pakistani source of income-earning in the relevant tax year in the respective head of income.

								On other side, the foreign income is required to be declared in the "Foreign Income" section. This is significant to know that Non-Resident Pakistani or Overseas Pakistani are not required to file their Wealth statement and Tax Return to enjoy their Filer status.

    			What is the need of overseas Pakistanis to become tax filers in Pakistan?

    					There are numerous advantages of becoming a filer in Pakistan. For example, on becoming tax filers in Pakistan.
    					<ul class="check-lists px-5">
    						<li>
    							They can get the opportunity of bearing lower taxes on financial transactions involving tax. A status of tax filer is beneficial for non-resident Pakistanis who wish to have investments in real estate, stock exchange, saving schemes, mutual funds, and prize bonds etc.
    						</li>
    						<li>
    							Formerly, non-filer overseas Pakistanis were restricted from purchasing any property in Pakistan. Though the government has removed that restriction, a non-filer is restricted to purchase a property exceeding PKR 50 lakh. For the time being, there is no particular limit set for filers.
    						</li>
    						<li>
    							Additionally, as compare to non-filers, active taxpayers are only required to pay 1/2 of the withholding tax. On becoming tax filers by overseas Pakistanis, they will have to pay fifty percent lower tax on the purchase of motor vehicles.
    						</li>
    						<li>
    							Tax filers in Pakistan have to pay only fifteen percent tax on winning prize money through Prize bond, however, non-filers have to pay twenty-five percent tax on the same.
    						</li>
    						<li>
    							There are multiple advantages of being a tax filer in Pakistan. For example, if overseas Pakistanis become a Tax Filer, they can have an advantage of paying lower taxes on almost 100+ instances, including tax involved in banking transactions, vehicle registration, and transfer of immovable property, etc.
    						</li>
    						<li>
    							It is vital to consider for overseas Pakistanis that if they have a plan to buy movable or immovable assets in Pakistan, for example, a vehicle or a house exclusively by using foreign income, they have a chance to save a lot of money in the form of withholding taxes by just taking a status of filer.
    						</li>
    						<li>
    							Furthermore, it can also assist in declaring that Pakistan's total assets purchased from a foreign course are not taxable. By this way, the overseas Pakistani can also remove the burden of an audit by Tax Authorities in Pakistan and are therefore completely safe as per the Pakistani Laws.
