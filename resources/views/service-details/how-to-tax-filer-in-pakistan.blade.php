This means that if Pakistani is receiving remuneration from an employer in Pakistan then his income tax at source will most likely be deducted from his salary even if he ex-pats residing in a foreign country.</li>
							<li>It is essential to mention that just deduction of income tax from your salary does not mean that you have become a tax filer automatically. To be acknowledged as a filer in Pakistan, you are required to be added to the Federal Board of Revenue's Active Taxpayers List.</li>
							<li>Furthermore, suppose an ex-pat has immovable or movable assets in Pakistan, such as a house or a motor vehicle which is purchased exclusively from foreign income. In this case, there is need to prove that the money was remitted outside the country. They need to apprehend that the said transaction was carried out via proper channels and as per instructions mentioned by the State Bank of Pakistan. In 2018, FBR decided to waive off the withholding tax applicable on the withdrawals of remittances, i.e. the funds sent to the home (Pakistan) by a non-resident Pakistanis.</li>
