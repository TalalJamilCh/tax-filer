						Limited liability partnership (LLP) is that partnership concern where some or all partners have their limited liabilities. It, therefore, displays the requisites of companies and partnerships. In LLP, each partner is not responsible for another partner's wrongdoing or negligence, and some or all partners have limited liability as that of the company's shareholders. However, partners of an LLP have the right to manage the business directly as compare to the companyâ€™s shareholders.

					</div>
					<div class="desc mb-20">
	    				Limited liability partnership is almost a new business structure introduced in Pakistan. It was introduced by the SECP in 2017. This step by the SECP was taken due to a demand on a high level for a substitute to the existing partnership structure, i.e. (A.O.P.) and private limited company incorporation. It is a substitute which permits entrepreneurs to organize their business activities flexibly and innovatively.
